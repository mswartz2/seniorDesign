Meeting 2-3-21 at 3:40 pm
Members in attendance: Maria, Kyle, Yikai, Brent


Updates:
Kyle - Worked on creating a procedure to load data from TicketMaster.
Yikai - Worked with Maria on implementing user profiles. She got the drop down working for selecting a state. 
City will be entered manually (no drop-down). 
Brent - Looked into sending automatic emails. He ran into some issues with connecting Hangfire to ASP.NET
Maria - Added almost all of the attributes to the user class. Now, the user can add information about themselves
when signing up for an account. 


We also discussed how to implement emails with recommendations. We are just going to a couple send emails with the top
events in a city for each user interest so that users aren't bombarded with too many event suggestions.


Design changes:
	-Kyle decided that we should just use the built in ASP.NET database instead of having a database on a virtual machine
	because cuase the machine was getting to expensive.
	-We also might limit the cities some of the top cities and Laramie.


Things to complete this week:
Maria - Finish fixing the user categories/interests, make a user profile page, help Brent use Hangfire to send emails
Kyle  - work on finish mapping the TicketMaster data and finish the stored procedures for getting and deleting data from the 
correct table and get updates with duplicate data working correctly. If time permits, he will start work on getting the Eventful 
data to load as well.
Brent - Get an automatic email to send to a user. Maria will help with this. 
Yikai - fix location for user profile. If time permits, also look into different html formatting options or themes.


Next meeting Wednesday at 3:40pm
Maria and Brent will also be meeting Friday at 9:00 am
