Meeting 1-30-21 at 10:00 am
Members in attendance: Maria, Kyle, Yikai

Kyle was having some issues connecting to the Azure site, so we trouble shot this for a while.
We determined that it was an issue with his Visual Studio, not with the project.

We discovered that the VM idea is actually going to be quite expensive to have running, so we aren't
going use it. Instead, we will write queries that we will manually run.

Maria sent Gamboa an email about setting up a meeting time, but we still need decide on a 
definite mentor meeting time.


Things to complete this week:
Maria - Set up GitHub with all the new docs for semester 2
      - Finish setting up database design
      - Figure out how to connect Azure and GitHub (project is in Azure but needs to be in GitHub too)
      - help Yikai user searching

Yikai - Set up user login info
      - Saving what the user searches for

Kyle  - Come up with list of all potential categories. 
      - Connect with Eventful

Brent - Implement sending automatic emails
      - Finish setting up the Trello Board

Since we don't have real data loaded in the database yet, Maria and Yikai will work make a search
bar and have what the user types displayed at the top of the page that lists all of the pseudo 
events. The main point of this is to just save what the user does and send it to another page of 
the application.


Next meeting Wednesday at 3:40
